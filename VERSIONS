Changes in Version 0.9.0

  Sleepy has been floating around for a long time within retickr as
  the basis for our RESTful apis. We are just now formalizing the
  release process now that we have several apis to in sync with
  different sleepy versions. This is the version of sleepy which we
  plan to release on launch day for the mynews api.


  Features

  * A new decorator RequiresUrlAttribute for checking that a
    particular element was matched in the url pattern for a given
    function. This is helpfule for sleepy objects that have multiple
    http type methods implemented for the same regular expression or
    that have multiple regular expressions pointing to them

  * All configuration has been removed from sleepy. Anything that
    requires database access should go in the project.
