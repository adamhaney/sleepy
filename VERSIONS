Changes in Version 0.9.5
  Updated helpers.py to include the new retick email template.
  
Changes in Version 0.9.4
  Bug fixes added a few helper functions to sleepy.helpers and
  brought 404 function's JSON into compliance with our error
  standards. Also, pulled out some dead/unused/unneccasry code.

  Features

  * Added helpers.unexpected_error which prints an error message out

  * Updated helpers.index to print out a properly formatted
    json error with proper content type

  Removed Support

  * We are now making better use of Django's error reporting instead
    of trying to roll our own. Because of this we removed the
    BaseServerError object.

  * show_urls function in helpers never really worked. We've
    removed it.
  

Changes in Version 0.9.3
  Bug fixes.

Changes in Version 0.9.2
  This version introduces headers and fixes a few bugs.

  Features

  * Introduced a headers field for responses that allows the application
    developer to pass back custom headers in a response

  * Cleaned up code and stopped passing around a few object variables.

  * Extended documentation

  * Introduced ParameterMax decorator that guards api calls from
    receiving parameters that are too high in value.

Changes in Version 0.9.1

  This version is primarily about updating documentation and cleaning
  a few things up. It introduces more parameters for redirect_out
  which will allow for some shorter code in apis that ouput
  urls.

  Features

  * Introduced the meta_info, url_key_name and status_code
    parameters for the redirect_out call. Also, the
    redirect_out call now ouputs JSON with the 302 response
    so if the client doesn't adhere to the response code
    properly it will still display the url that it would
    have redirected to.

Changes in Version 0.9.0

  Sleepy has been floating around for a long time within retickr as
  the basis for our RESTful apis. We are just now formalizing the
  release process now that we have several apis to in sync with
  different sleepy versions. This is the version of sleepy which we
  plan to release on launch day for the mynews api.


  Features

  * A new decorator RequiresUrlAttribute for checking that a
    particular element was matched in the url pattern for a given
    function. This is helpfule for sleepy objects that have multiple
    http type methods implemented for the same regular expression or
    that have multiple regular expressions pointing to them

  * All configuration has been removed from sleepy. Anything that
    requires database access should go in the project.
